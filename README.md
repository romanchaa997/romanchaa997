## What I bring to teams (Hiring)

- **AI/ML in production**: LLM‑based analytics and security reasoning wired into real pipelines, not one‑off scripts.  
- **Infra & DevOps**: Cloudflare‑centric infra, Docker, k8s manifests, GitHub/GitLab CI/CD, observability and security by default.  
- **Product mindset**: From prototype to SaaS‑ready platform (onboarding, pricing, payments, docs).

---

## Product ecosystem (core projects)

- 🛡️ **Audityzer** – For Web3 teams and security researchers; reduces time from contract deployment to actionable risk overview by automating smart‑contract analysis, monitoring and reporting.  
- 📊 **Heatmap SaaS API** – For product and infra teams; turns raw events into actionable heatmaps and analytics with a ready SaaS layer (gateway, workers, rate limiting, billing).  
- 🧩 **Structurizer** – For engineers starting new products; generates clean, AI‑aware TypeScript project structure and architecture so teams can ship faster with consistent patterns.  
- 🏛️ **Civic / GovTools** – For digital government and civic tech; applies the same security and SaaS patterns to public‑sector analytics and services.

See repositories for architecture details, tech stack and roadmaps.

## Tech stack & practices

- **Languages**: Python, Node.js / TypeScript (backends, CLIs, integrations).  
- **Infrastructure**: Cloudflare Workers/Pages, Docker, k8s manifests, GitHub/GitLab CI/CD, monitoring and IaC across main repos.  
- **AI/ML**: LLM‑based contract analysis, batch analytics pipelines, AI‑assisted boilerplate and architecture generation.
